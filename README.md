# Mission Statement

Visualizing the change and making the right decision. 
The city of Fredericton has taken steps to balance urban growth with environmental protection. For example, the city has developed a comprehensive plan for managing its forests, which includes regular assessments of the health and diversity of the trees, as well as measures to control invasive species and minimize the impact of human activities. In addition, the city has implemented zoning regulations and other policies to encourage sustainable development that minimizes the impact on natural habitats. For example, the city requires developers to include green space in their plans and to preserve existing trees and vegetation whenever possible.
Despite these efforts, there are still concerns about the long-term impact of urban growth on the forests of Fredericton. As the city continues to expand, there is a need for ongoing monitoring and management to ensure that natural habitats are protected and preserved.

# TreeHome App

TreeHome App is a web-based application that allows users to observe the Land use Land cover of the Fredericton city for the year 2017 and 2022. The raster file based on which the vector layer has been generated is download from ESRI/Sentinal-2 Land cover explorer and has a resolution of 10 m(Zhang, n.d.).The city boundary is download from Fredericton open data(City of Fredericton, n.d.).All the processing has been done using ESRI software like ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS online and ArcGIS web Appbuilder.
The app is created to show the different distribution of land use and land cover (LULC) of Fredericton city. And visualize the change that has occurred between the year 2017 and 2022 with the help of a dashboard and a story map. The app can display both whether or not the LULC class has changed and the new class that they have switched to. 
The main goal of the app is to provide the user with a way to see change in the LULC and especially the decline in the forest coverage over the years although many measures have been taken to preserve them.

## Key characteristics of the TreeHome App 

Map Display: The map display is the main feature of the TreeHome App, and it provides users with a detailed view of geographic data, including various layers and their attribute. TreeHome App contains two LULC layer for the year 2017 and 2022.The It Legend shows the classes present in the layer and we can easily switch the layers to visualize them individually. 
Search Functionality: The TreeHome App offers users the ability to search for specific locations, addresses, or points of interest within the map. This feature makes it easy for users to find the information they need quickly. 
Interactive Tools: The TreeHome App offers a wide range of interactive tools, including measurement tools and direction tools. These tools enable users to interact with the map and manipulate data. 
Customizable Themes: The TreeHome App allows users to customize the visual appearance of their application by choosing from a range of customizable themes and styles. We can even change the base map. 
Data Sharing: the TreeHome App makes it easy for users to share their data and applications with others. Users can share their applications with specific groups or make them available to the public. 
Data Visualization: One of the main features of the App is that it provides users with various options for data visualization, which includes a dashboard and a story map.

The dashboard displays each class's percentage distribution for the years 2017 and 2022. The proportion has been shown using a pie chart, along with a legend that lists the entire area in square metres that made up that percentage underneath the pie chart. The LULC layer is also displayed on the dashboard, and we can easily flip between the layers and acquire details about a polygon by just left-clicking on it. For example, we can left-click on any polygon, then use the next feature and previous feature options to view the change between the two years. In some areas we can clearly observe some forest in 2017 being converted to built area. We can not only visualize all the data in one place on the dashboard, but we can even expand them individually.

Then the App contains a story map with the title Home for nature versus Home for human. It explains the context in which this app was created and conveys the message that despite all efforts to conserve them, the amount of forest cover is declining. The story map illustrates a portion of the Fredericton region where the forest has been converted to other classes.
